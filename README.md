Drawbridge is a lightweight API gateway written in Go.

- No datastore needed - APIs are defined by a yaml config file.

## Configuration

Drawbridge acts as a reverse proxy for one or more APIs.
The APIs can be configured in a yaml file called `config.yaml`.

Each API definition must have the following properties:
 - `name`- a friendly name for the API
 - `prefix` - the path prefix
 - `upstream_url` - the target URL to proxy to

```yaml
apis:
  reqres:
      name: "JSONPlaceholder"
      prefix: "typicode"
      upstream_url: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
```

If the drawbridge server was running at localhost:5000, http://localhost:5000/typicode/posts would proxy to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.

## Development

The project includes a Docker Compose file and some useful targets in the Makefile to allow you to easily set up a
development environment.

To prepare the image for development, use `make build-image`.

```bash
$ make build-image
```

This will build the docker image and then install dependencies with the mounted volumes.

The image contains two stages: 
- `builder` with go installed
- `prod` with only compiled version.

To build the dev image use `make build-image`.

Even though `dep` dependencies are installed when the Docker image is built, they must be installed again when developing because the volume mount will overwrite the /vendor directory in the container.
Notice that after running `make update`, you have a local `vendor/` directory. Please do not commit this directory to git.

Similarly, the application must be compiled again when using the development volume mounts. This is easy using `make build`.
Once compiled, the application can be run using `make start`.
These can be combined into `make build start`.
A normal development workflow might look like

```Shell
$ make update
$ make build start
$ Ctrl+c
[make some code changes]
$ make build start
$ Ctrl+c
```
Where `Ctrl+c` stops the running Docker container.

### Installing new packages

If, during development, you need to use a new package that has not been previously installed, use `make dep-add`.

```bash
$ make dep-add pkg=[package name]
```

For example, to add the `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` package, run `make dep-add pkg=github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify`.
